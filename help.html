    <p> Our coral reefs are decreasing at an alarming rate as global stresses compound into the increasing degredation of our acquatic environment.
        Corals reefs are herald as the "rain forests of the see" that have over 4000 species if biodiverse acquatic life, but make up less than 1 %
        of the ocean. According to Reefs at Risk Revisted over 75% of the world's coral reefs are in danger. If we continue with the current state of
        affairs towards coral reefs, by 2030, 90 percent of all reefs will be in dangers, and by 2050 all of them will be.

        <h2>There is too much pollution!</h2>
        Over 8 million tons of plastic end up in our ocean every year and it makes up 80% of all marine debris inside of the oceans. This
        is a fairly unacceptable amount of plastic waste as marine biologists have been reprimanding major businesses that plastic waste
        kills a multitude of marine life every year.
